# Feed Reader Tester

This project demonstrates browser based testing using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io). It tests the Feed Reader app built by [Udacity](https://udacity.com) for [Front-end Web Development Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## How to run the app

- [Download](https://github.com/aravindio/feed-reader-tester/archive/master.zip) & extract (or) clone this repo
- `cd` into the root of this repo
- Open `index.html` file in your preferred browser

**Note:** The content may take some time to load and it may change more than once. This is because the testing framework Jasmine is loading feeds in the background.

## Technologies/Libraries used

- CSS3
- jQuery
